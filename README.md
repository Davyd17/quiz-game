# quiz-game

This is a game where you answer pre-construct questions on various topics.

The goal of this game is to pre-construct a series of questions with 4 answer options, one of which is correct,
along with a category associated with the same level of difficulty.
Each question must be categorized, and there must be at least 5 questions per category, where one question from that
category is randomly selected for each round. 
There must be 5 rounds in the entire game, and each round awards prizes (points or money) when
the player answers correctly.
The accumulated prizes are part of the contest, but if the player wishes to leave the game, they can withdraw before
answering the question.
 If, on the other hand, the player loses, they would leave the game without the accumulated prizes
they had at that moment.
